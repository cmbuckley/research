\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I would like to thank Stefan Dantchev, who has been my supervisor for both my third-year dissertation and my thesis. His intuition and knowledge in the field have been paramount in the writing of this thesis, and without which I would have had no idea where to even begin.

Also thanks go to S{\o}ren Riis, Stefan's Ph.D. supervisor, who has pioneered the concept of guessing numbers, and in personal communication has solved some of the most difficult questions I have had with this work, seemingly with ease.

Last, but by no means least, many thanks to my family and friends for supporting and putting up with me throughout my undergraduate degree and whilst I have been writing my thesis. I couldn't have finished it without you!
