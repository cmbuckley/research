As part of my MSc by Research at the [University of Durham](https://www.durham.ac.uk/), I specialised in theorectical computer science, namely in network coding.

## Supervisors

* [Dr Stefan Dantchev](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/s-s-dantchev/)
* Prof Hajo Broersma

### Erdős numbers

Stefan has Erdős number 3, and Hajo has Erdős number 2 (using the [MathSciNet collaboration distance tool](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html)). For more information, see the [article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number).

In addition, much of the input was provided by [Søren Riis](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~smriis/), Stefan’s old PhD supervisor. His Erdős number is 2.

## Research group

[Algorithms and Complexity in Durham](https://algorithmscomplexity.webspace.durham.ac.uk/)

## Current work

My main work was on extending the research by Søren. The work concentrates mainly on a new area of network coding called **guessing numbers**.

## Documents

[Guessing Numbers Based on Network Routing Capacity](/research/thesis.pdf), my masters thesis. Also [available on Durham e-Theses](http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/2072/).
